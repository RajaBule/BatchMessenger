# BatchMessenger
Old high-school project between me and a close friend. Just a very simple and limited messenger written in batch.


Hello and thank you for your interest in this project. It is a very simple messenger that is not very practical but was fun creating in high-school. I decided to revive the project just for the heck of it. Feel free to make changes and what not.
